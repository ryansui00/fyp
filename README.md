Research Topic: Utilizing Machine Learning in Conjunction with Density Functional Theory for Rapid Prediction and Screening of Low Bandgap Polymers

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a potential alternative to computationally expensive molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT) simulations for polymer property prediction in the field of polymer informatics. In this study, the performance of 25 ML models will be evaluated on a training dataset of 3381 polymers with bandgap values derived through DFT simulations from the Polymer Genome project. Each model is made up of 3 main components: structure representations, feature representations, and ML techniques. The structure representation used in this study is the simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) notation of the polymer constitutional repeating unit (CRU). The feature representations tested are Morgan Fingerprints (ECFP4) with the option of capturing substructure frequency information, molecular embedding (ME), MinHashed atom-pair fingerprint (MAP4), and a feature set of 200 RDKit descriptors. The feature representations are then subject to the following ML techniques: random forest (RF), support vector machines (SVM), Gaussian process regression (GPR), convolutional neural networks (CNN), and recurrent neural network (RNN).  Using 5-fold k-cross validation, the ML model utilising MF with substructure frequency information and RF regression was found to have the highest performance on the test set (r^2≈0.87). Models utilising CNN and RNN algorithms also displayed similar results although greater extents of overfitting were observed. The model was then implemented on the PI1M polymer informatics dataset, consisting of ~1 million polymers, from which 1280 potential polymer structures exhibiting low bandgaps were identified. Based on the distribution of predicted glass transition temperatures (T_g) of the filtered polymers, derived from models from other benchmark studies, 10 potential low bandgap polymers with predicted T_g values ranging from -23-325°C were selected and subject to DFT simulation. Analysis of the simulation results found that predicted values from the ML model exhibited small deviations from the DFT-simulated results (r^2≈0.8637). Based on the results, the study showcases the viability of ML techniques in the rapid prediction and screening of polymer bandgaps. Furthermore, as more high quality, experimentally-determined polymer data is obtained, the predictive capabilities of such models would only continue to improve.

Repository contains code and models for the final year project on the aforementioned research topic.

Additional notes: With the exception of map4-based models, all code was run on a M1 MacBook Pro. Due to certain package restrictions, the map4-based models were run on a Windows-based PC setup.
